About Me
I am a student of Artificial Intelligence (AI), passionate about solving problems and building efficient solutions through algorithms and data structures.

Repository Overview
This repository showcases my journey through the DSA course, featuring:

Implementations of fundamental data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.).
Key algorithms, including sorting, searching, and dynamic programming.
Practice problems and solutions from competitive programming platforms.
Assignments and projects related to DSA concepts.
Purpose
The goal of this repository is to document my learning, share my progress, and demonstrate my skills in DSA. It also serves as a portfolio for future reference and improvement.
